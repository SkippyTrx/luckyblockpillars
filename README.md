WorldMap + Files required to play a LuckyBlock pillar challenge with up to 4 people. Based on youtube challenges I saw, requires external plugins MyCommand and ntdLuckyBlock.

Instructions:
1. Download world.zip from repo and upload it to your server
2. Install PLugins MyCommand,ntdLuckyBlock
3. Place clearpillars.yml + pillars.yml files inside plugins/MyCommand/commands (May need to restart server to generate folders)
4. Run /reload 

Enjoy!
yml files are brutal LOL

I've only tested on 1.21.8 because I'm lazy but pretty sure it will work for most recent versions
